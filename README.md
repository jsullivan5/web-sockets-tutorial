# Socket.io Tutorial

### This exercise was completed as an introduction to web sockets through socket.io.

## Objectives - Create a basic real-time chat app with the following features:

  - Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
  - Add support for nicknames
  - Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
  - Add “{user} is typing” functionality
